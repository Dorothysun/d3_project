To get started with this project, go to the command line (this assumes you already have node installed on your machine):

1. Navigate to this project's roots folder (using `cd`)
2. `npm install` to get all the dependencies
3. `npm start` to start the server (then leave this running)
4. Open http://localhost:8080 in a web browser

If you open up dev tools, you should see an example of running the simulation logging some info.

Look at browser.js to see how to use the simulation code (and look at simulation.js if you're curious to see the guts of how the simulator is doing what it does).

Now use the simulation—which will generate data for you—to visualize the results with d3!
